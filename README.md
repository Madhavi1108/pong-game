Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games, originally created in 1972 by Atari. It simulates table tennis, where two paddles and a ball are used to engage in a back-and-forth game. The objective is for players to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

In this project, we'll be implementing a basic version of Pong using [your chosen programming language or framework, e.g., Python with Pygame, JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas, etc.]. This implementation will demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as game loops, collision detection, and user input handling.

The game consists of two paddles, one controlled by the player and the other by the computer (or a second player). The ball moves across the screen, bouncing off the paddles and the top and bottom edges. When the ball passes a paddle, the opponent scores a point. The game continues until a player reaches a predefined score or until itâ€™s manually stopped.

Key Features of the Pong Game Code:
Game Loop: Continuously updates the game state and redraws the screen.
Paddle Movement: Allows player and AI-controlled paddles to move up and down.
Ball Mechanics: Handles ball movement, bouncing off paddles and walls.
Collision Detection: Detects when the ball hits a paddle or passes the screen edges.
Scoring System: Keeps track of and displays player scores.
User Input: Processes keyboard or mouse input for paddle control.
This code will serve as a foundational example of how to develop a simple game, and can be expanded with additional features such as sound effects, improved AI, or enhanced graphics.
